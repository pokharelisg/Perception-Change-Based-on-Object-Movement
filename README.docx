#major project BE 4th year

In this project, we consider a sub-problem of object recognition: object motion detection, 
in which we are interested in recognizing object based solely on the characteristic patterns
of motion that they exhibit. This approach diï¬€ers from other techniques for object detection,
such as those that recognize objects based on shape, color, texture, or surface features.
